      <h1>About TECH50K</h1>
      <p>
        “Fifty Thousand Syrian Technicians” is a national developmental
        initiative presented by the Syrian British Professionals Network, aiming
        to build a qualified Syrian digital generation capable of innovation and
        competing in the global knowledge- and technology-based economy. The
        initiative is based on the belief that digital and programming skills
        are the new language of production and innovation, and that investing in
        Syrian human capital is essential for digital transformation and
        national development.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to create a Syrian digital renaissance that empowers Syrians
        to be active contributors in shaping the digital future rather than mere
        consumers. Our vision focuses on building a broad community of Syrian
        technicians capable of producing technological solutions that serve
        development and reconstruction, competing in global markets through
        remote work and digital entrepreneurship, while promoting women's
        participation and including disadvantaged groups.
